On cold and dreary days, you'll be getting advice from a malcontent. You have been warned.</p> <p>The Moody Eight Ball was the creation of the preDevCamp:New York hosted by BlueSwitch in downtown Manhattan in August 2009. The event was led by Michael Prenez-Isbell from <a href=\"http://blueswitch.com/\">BlueSwitch</a> in their New York offices, and Eric Marthinsen of <a href=\"http://www.agilecommerce.com/\">Agile Commerce</a> led the Hackathon team of 30 developers from such diverse companies as 360iDev, Merrill Lynch and American Express. The Moody Eight Ball was coded over the course of two days and was many people's first foray into webOS development. The application was designed to exploit many of the capabilities of webOS and the device, including the accelerometer, location services, web service integration, and the clipboard.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p>", "Category":"Games", "Screenshots":["http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/screenshots/openingScreen.png"], "Source":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/com.agilecommerce.predevcamp_1.0.0_all.ipk", "Type":"Application", "Location":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/com.agilecommerce.predevcamp_1.0.0_all.ipk", "Feed":"PreCentral" }

This app works just like the android version, tap the screen to make it shine. Tapping it more will make it brighter and also turn it off. The first tap gives 50 mA's to the LED. The second gives 100, and the third gives 200 mA's to the LED.

HoshiDict is currently unable to extract the archive file directly, so you'll need to manually extract the files.

Inevitably I am leaving that list in the car or even worse, on the counter at home. I pretty much always have my phone though. I did try to use the notes app or other substitutes, but I wanted something that was easier to use and designed with the list writer in mind. I wanted it to be as close to writing on a piece of paper as it could be on the phone, but better. Because I usually have more than one place to go, it needed to support multiple lists. I wanted to be able to easily see if I have picked up the item on the list or accomplished the task so it needed an indicator of completion. I wanted the lists to be flexible, easily edited and rearranged to my needs. Sometimes I get the same thing from a store weekly so I wanted to be able to reset whether it was completed or not so I could reuse a list or maybe several items on the list. Most of all I wanted it to be simple to use. If it was too complicated I did not think I would use it.   From this came EasyList.  EasyList allows you to: -\tList out many items, even multi-line items as needed on each list -\tgive your lists meaningful names for your needs -\tstore multiple lists for different needs -\tcheck off completed items -\trearrange items in order of importance -\treuse and edit old lists as wanted, just uncheck needed items -\tdelete items that are not needed anymore -\tdelete whole lists if not needed anymore  I have been using EasyList for a while now and it has gone through several iterations. I hope you test it out and that you find it as useful as I do. If you have any suggestions for increasing the usability, I am interested to hear them.</p>", "Category":"Productivity", "Screenshots":["http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/screenshots/EasyList.jpg"], "Source":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/com.cgraysoft.easylist_1.0.2_all.ipk", "Type":"Application", "Location":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/com.cgraysoft.easylist_1.0.2_all.ipk", "Feed":"PreCentral" }

It uses the existing course data provided by <a href=\"http://www.bbgpsgolf.com/\" title=\"www.bbgpsgolf.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bbgpsgolf.com</a>, a free golf gps application for Blackberry users. This application comes with many features such as: Create players with their current handicap, create and add courses locally from the <a href=\"http://www.bbgpsgolf.com/\" title=\"www.bbgpsgolf.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bbgpsgolf.com</a> database.  Courses can be added by name or within x miles of your current location.  New courses can be can be added at the <a href=\"http://www.bbgpsgolf.com/\" title=\"www.bbgpsgolf.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bbgpsgolf.com</a> website. Once you have players and courses in the application you can start a round of golf and keep scoring for up to four players. You can decided to play 18 holes or 9 holes, the front 9 first or the back 9 first. Scoring keeps track of shots, putts, GIR (done automatically) and fairways hit, FH. The score will also keep track of your current score to par.</p> <p>GPS data is also available (if available on the course data from <a href=\"http://www.bbgpsgolf.com/\" title=\"www.bbgpsgolf.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bbgpsgolf.com</a>) and can be viewed for each hole quite easily. Distances normally show front, center and back of green as well as up to 5 additional items of interest. Golf Caddie will also suggest which club to use to the front, center and back of the green when in range. This is based upon the clubs in your bag (defined under preferences) and the min/max distance for each club.</p> <p>Once a round is complete a full scoring card can be seen for each player. The round can be saved and previous rounds can be viewed.</p> <p>Future features that will be added to the app are some of the following:</p> <ul><li>Addition of preferences to identify distances for each club that will allow for a club suggestion when playing a shot. (DONE)</li><li>Ability to edit course data such as add additional tees. (DONE)</li><li>Keep track of driving distances(DONE), penalty shots and sand saves.</li><li>Provide statistics for each player that has a score in the app. (DONE)</li><li>Keep track of all players handicaps by updating them at the end of a round. (DONE)</li></ul> <p>Licensing conditions: This application is available for free whilst it is in Beta realse, but cannot be redistributed, and the source code is not open source. This application is being submitted to the Pre App Store and will be available to purchase at that time.</p> <p>Installation: No special instructions are required, the app should install/delete like most other homebrew apps using the SDK method.</p> <p>Playing instructions:</p> <ul>Start the app and create at least 1 player.  Ideally the first player that is created should be identified as the Pre owner.</ul> <ul>Search for courses and save the courses to the local application database. Existing tees will be downloaded with the course if they exist, otherwise default Blue tees will be created.</ul> <ul>Start a round of golf. Choose the course, the tees and up to 4 players. Choose to play 18 holes or 9 holes, front 9 first or back 9 first.</ul> <ul>On the score card there are numerous options available. The score and putts are tapable and can easily be selected. The FH (fairway hit) can be tapped to set the checkmark. GIR is automatically calculated based on the score, par and number of putts so no need to do anything here. It is displayed to show if the GIR was achieved. Moving between holes can be done in a couple of ways. Select either the left or right arrows in the upper part of the screen to move to the next or previous hole, or tap the hole number to move directly to another hole.

Also, when they go back into the  generator, or the wrong port, the engine heats up a little.  The bar  below the play area fills up as the engine gets hotter.  Tap the game  area somewhere other than the diverters, or press P, or physically shake  your Pre, to cool the engine down a bit.  The game ends if the engine  overheats.  It's a very challenging game that will take a great deal of  concentration, planning ahead and quick reactions to avoid disaster!</p>", "Category":"Games", "Screenshots":["http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/screenshots/ss_engineer.png"], "Source":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/com.etherient.engineer_1.0.2_all.ipk", "Type":"Application", "Location":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/com.etherient.engineer_1.0.2_all.ipk", "Feed":"PreCentral" }

The goal of the app was to greatly enhance the user experience and allow people to access and manage their music more effectively. A number of features, some truly revolutionary, have been incorporated to help accomplish this goal. Some of them include:</p>\n<p><br />\n\t- \"Faves\" are items you can pin to your home screen for one-touch easy access. They can be songs, albums, artists, genres, playlists, or flylists.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- \"Flylists\" are playlists you create and manage on-the-fly, on your device. You can now add songs, albums, artists, genres, or playlists to a flylist. And items in a flylist will update dynamically when you add new songs to your device.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Configuration icons at the top of the screen to force the screen to stay on while using the music app and to lock screen orientation (portrait or landscape).<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Sleep timer configurable on the home screen<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Newly designed \"now playing\" screen with finger-friendly music controls, scrolling song/artist/album info, and scrubber bar.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Function icons at the top of the \"now playing\" screen for returning to the home screen, adding the current song to a flylist or the faves list, viewing lyrics, saving a bookmark, and viewing the current playlist.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Ability to scrub through the current song from the \"current playlist\" view.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Ability to queue up the next song by tapping on an icon next to a song in the \"current playlist\" view.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- \"Playlist Preview Mode\" which allows you to swipe the screen left or right to browse your current playlist via the album art without interrupting the playback of the current song. You can also queue up a song to play next by swiping up.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- \"Quick artist search\": Tapping on the song/artist/album info on the \"now playing\" screen will bring up the albums of the artist. You can do this in playlist preview mode as well.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- \"Universal search\": A revolutionary way to quickly find your music by simply typing. Instantly all songs, albums, artists, genres, playlists, and flylists that match your search string will appear on the screen. You can either start a new playlist with one of your search results or tap the \"+\" icon next to a result to add the item to the current playlist, save it to a flylist, or save it as a fave.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- webOS 2.0 Just Type and Quick Action support (only available in the app catalog version): Find a song, album, artist, genre, playlist, or flylist by typing a search string without having to open the app first. Launch a playlist, flylist, or autolist without having to first open the app.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Control your music and current playlist via keyboard controls<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- \"Mini-player\": Using webOS's unique notification system in a way never before implemented in a webOS app, you now have complete control over your music while using other apps. You have a scrubber bar, music controls, and the playlist preview controls all of which are configurable by the user. You can also minimize the app into a lightweight mini-player mode which eliminates the main card.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Wallpaper customization: Assign a custom wallpaper image for Music Player (Remix) or use the one assigned on your device and make the app's card semi-transparent when minimizing it.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Last.FM scrobbling: Let Music Player (Remix) automatically keep track of your played songs and submit them to Last.FM.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Advanced manual and automatic bookmarking which include visual indicators on the Now Playing screen of any saved bookmarks within a song, the ability to quickly jump from one bookmark/chapter to another by tapping the next or previous buttons. Also bookmarks are saved automatically in every playlist and flylist so you can resume where you left off in a list.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Autolists (only available in the app catalog version): Music Player (Remix) will automatically generate playlists based upon certain conditions such as play count and last play date.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Social Networking Integration: You can post your currently playing song to either Twitter or Facebook. And your followers/friends can view its YouTube video embedded on your page. Other Music Player (Remix) users can view your posted songs on the new Discovery screen.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- Fine-tuned music controls: Tap and hold the album art on the Now Playing screen to reveal controls for skipping forwards or backwards by 5, 30, and 60 seconds. You can also use keyboard shortcuts for the fine-tuned music controls. - Quick shortcuts: Create Launcher shortcuts for your favorite playlists, flylists, autolists (webOS 2.0 only), or albums. Also create shortcuts for auto-resuming and shuffling your music.</p>\n<p>- Album Art Downloading (only available in the app catalog version):&nbsp; Download album art on the newly designed album song list screen and assign it to every track in that album.</p>\n<p>- Karaoke Mode (conly available in the app catalog version): Record yourself as you sing along to your favorite songs.&nbsp; View the lyrics of the song while recording to make sure you don't miss a beat.</p>\n<p>- Custom Now Playing gestures (only available in the app catalog version):&nbsp; Assign custom actions when swiping up or down on the Now Playing screen's album art.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the app catalog version, here's a demonstration video:&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSizEy3b_OU<br />\n\t<br />\n\tI hope everyone enjoys using the app and will come by the PreCentral homebrew thread to share feedback with me.</p>\n", "Category":"Music", "Screenshots":["http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/screenshots/mpr_now_playing_screen_preview.png"], "Source":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/com.hedami.musicplayerremix_2.5.11_all.ipk", "Type":"Application", "Location":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/com.hedami.musicplayerremix_2.5.11_all.ipk", "Feed":"PreCentral" }

This engine is completely free to use for all purposes, including commercial uses. However, if you modify it you need to post it here so others benefit too!</strong> <br /> <br /> Right now it is a little sluggish on the pre but runs great on the emulator! I would say that it runs better in the emulator then in Firefox or even Chrome. <br /> <br /> Controls: <br /> <strong>Tap</strong> anywhere on the screen and a circle or square will appear. <br /> <strong>Hold</strong> the screen to reset the scene <br /> <br /> There is extensive documentation of this engine. Simply look at the Flash docs! Also, this is a very robust engine capable of many different uses. You can have multiple gravities, stationary objects, rotating objects, and you can even create your own custom shapes! <br /> <br /> This engine uses the canvas tag to render all shapes. <br /> <br /> <strong style=\"font-size: 18px;\">I am a poor college student. <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=T4WTV3L2UPLKC&lc=US&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted\" target=\"_blank\">Please donate by clicking here and help me through college!</a></strong></p>", "Category":"Reference", "Screenshots":["http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/screenshots/app1.png"], "Source":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/com.livewire1337.fyzix_0.9.0_all_0.ipk", "Type":"Application", "Location":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/com.livewire1337.fyzix_0.9.0_all_0.ipk", "Feed":"PreCentral" }

The DRM schemes of MobiPocket and eReader are fully supported, whereas the ePub DRM isn't (yet). The files are read directly from the media partition, so that no prior conversion is necessary. Reading in landscape mode is fully supported as is basic customization of the text-size and appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>ATTENTION: Due to extensive changes, upgrading from a version prior to v0.7.0 <em>will</em> reset your complete library. You will lose and have to reload all books, their metadata and bookmarks. This only applies to the pReader's internal database. The original files on the disk will not be touched.</strong></p>\n<p>Since the application reads the book files directly off the media partition, just put the files on it, open the app, select \"Add Book To Library\", and select the file. The pReader will then add the file to its the internal library.</p>\n<p>If you leave the application / select a new book, your reading position will be stored and will be returned to if you reopen the file.</p>\n<p>The pReader also supports UTF-8 encoded files. Simply open your file, open the menu and change the encoding to UTF-8. Several other encodings are also supported.<br /><strong>Caveat:</strong> The fonts installed on the Pre don't contain Unicode Glyphs for some languages, like Hebrew. If you want to read those languages, you will <a href=\"http://forums.precentral.net/general-webos-chat/189477-modifying-replacing-fonts.html#post1993624\">need to install a custom font onto the Pre</a>, reboot the Pre and then select the Font name as a custom font in the pReader.

It's really simple and works like this: You define a \"trigger\" word (basically any combination of letters/numbers) and then you share that trigger word with people with whom you want to share your location.  When they want to find out where you're at, they just send you a text message with that trigger word somewhere in the message and Homing Device will get a GPS fix and send back a formatted google maps link with your location to them. It works automatically without any user intervention, but the request and response text messages will still show up in your chat thread so that you always have a history of who was requesting your location and when.   </p><p>While it's a far simpler and less sophisticated than server-based location apps (like Google latitude), it does have some unique advantages: \n* No server in the middle.  When someone wants your location, it's a direct \"point to point\" request/response - your location doesn't get sent to any server or other cloud-based system.  \n* Because it only gets a GPS fix when a request comes in, it's easy on your battery. \n* There's no special client app needed to request your location - all that's needed is the ability to send/receive text messages and the ability to open a google maps URL.  (either in a browser or a dedicated google maps app)  \n<p>Explanation of the settings in Homing Device:  \n<strong>Trigger Word</strong>: This is the special word you define that is used to get your location.  It cannot contain spaces, but otherwise can consist of any combination of letters and numbers. (case sensitive) \n<strong>Who can request my location?:</strong> This is an optional \"whitelist\", in which you can define the phone numbers of people you are allowing to request your location.  There are 2 different whitelist sections - one for picking a contact from your address book, and one for manually entering a phone number, email, or IM address.  So if you only want your wife to be able to request your location, you would tap the \"Add Contact...\" button in the first whitelist box and then choose her from your address book.  Anyone else who might request your location - even if they use the correct trigger word - will be denied.  <em>By leaving this list empty (the default), you are allowing anyone to request your location. </em></p>  <p><strong>Things to be aware of:</strong> \n* It runs in the background as a dashboard application.  If you swipe away the dashboard, it will close the app and will no longer be \"listening\" for incoming text messages.  This makes it easy to know when it's on and when it's not.  \n* This application is utilizing some non-public API's.  There is simply no way to make it work otherwise, and because of this it must be a homebrew app.  It's always possible (though probably not likely) that a future WebOS update could break this application.  (if that happens, I'll certainly do my best to fix it as quickly as I can)  \n* The GPS on the Pre will fall back to using cell-tower triangulation if it cannot find any satellites on which to fix.  This will result in a not-very-accurate location.  This typically only happens if you are inside a building and not near any windows.  I'm still tweaking the GPS-related code in Homing Device to try and get the most accurate location in the shortest amount of time, but if the GPS simply can't find any satellites than it may take a few minutes to send the result.</p>   \n<p>I wrote this for my own use and have been running it for a while successfully, though I figured there must be others out there who would find it useful as well.  Please let me know if you like it and if it's working for you.  If you have any suggestions for making it better, please let me know that too.

Mode Switcher also was changing my profile and things when all I wanted it to do was launch a single app.  App Trigger makes a nice alternative for the simple user out there.  Uses:  This app is mainly used to launch \"Internet Radio\" or \"Pandora\" both found in the product catalog, becuase these apps begin playing your last song on open.  Therefore, you can start your car up and music will automatically begin playng without you taking your phone out of your pocket.

The most notable new features are new options for what data is graphed, new graph design, and new details tracked.</p>  <p>With tracking mA (current or if you prefer consumption) one can use battery monitor to get accurate information on just how much battery is consumed for various things such as streaming audio or the screen at 100% brightness vs 10% brightness. Once Battery Monitor is started it only takes as few as 60 polls (1 hour at 1 minute intervals for example) to get a decent accuracy for this sort of monitoring. 90 polls for better accuracy and 120 for greater accuracy or more that 120 for greatest accuracy.</p>  <p>Stop by the official thread for discussion of upcoming and proposed changes. The link is at the end of the listing.  I know some will ask for a donate link so mine is below. However if it weren't for Jordan Neville designing the original app I would have never been able to update it. Therefore please consider primarily donating to him.

The default values for ASIN and TOTAL_LOCATIONS will work fine, however, if the default 15000 TOTAL_LOCATIONS is used your progress bar in the Kindle Application will not accurately represent your progress in the book (in our example you might be on the last page of the book but your progress bar might only show 30%).</p>\n<p>As mentioned above if you are not in the mood to rename all of your books you can make use of Calibre and/or m0ngr31s script. Calibre allows you to convert books from just about any format to mobi. Using the default settings calibre will convert the books to a compatible naming convention.

AI levels are: Toaster (Does only random moves), C3PO (Only knows the basic moves), Marvin (Knows even the special moves but is sometimes to depressed to use them) and HAL 9000 (Knows all the special moves and uses them, so it should be impossible to win against him).</li> <li>Beside choosing between human and computer AI the following preferences can be changed: Delays between computer moves and between end of game and start of new game, Fullscreen mode and suspend mode (Defines if game is suspended if application is minimized)</li> <li>German translation available.</li> </ul>  <p>This application is open source using the MIT License.

There are the obvious buttons in the bottom toolbar, including archiving the article, deleting it, marking as favorite (or unmark, if it already is marked as favorite). \"Copy url\" copies the article url into the system clipboard for you to share the article with your friends. The \"Refresh\" button forces a new download of the article content, if something has gone wrong or so.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tIf you tap the spritz button, the Spritz display opens. You see a canvas opening up in the middle of the screen displaying the first word of the article. Below that are a rewind button (rewinds to the first word), a back button (goes back one sentences), a play button (starts the action) a next button (goes to start of next sentence) and the display to how many words per minute (WPM) Spritz is currently configured.<br />\n\tAbove the word display is a login/logout button. In order to go faster than 450 WPM, Spritz requires you to log into an account, here you can start that progress.<br />\n\tI added some convenience tap areas. If you tap on the word display that is like play / pause. If you tap in the light grey area around the Spritz display you set the speed. The closer to the right screen your tap is the more WPM you will get. Also this is play / pause.<br />\n\tTo go back from spritzing either do a back gesture or tap on the dark grey area with the X.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tOne more secret trick:<br />\n\tIn the article list if you hold on the refresh button a popup will open. It contains three different refresh options. \"Fast refresh\" is what the button always does, it will process all actions that happened to your pocket account since the last sync. \"Full refresh\" will process your complete article list, throw away locally what is not on the server and download whatever might be missing. This can help if you feel your local list looks much different than the remote list. \"Delete &amp; refresh\" deletes all local content and starts a fresh. Do that if something really goes haywire.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tSettings are:<br />\n\tThe first setting allows sorting the article list differently. Either sort for date added, ascending or descending or article title or article url. These are the options that pocket allows.<br />\n\tThen there is the font size in the article view. No other font sizes can be configured. \"Go back on archive\" is default. If you deselect this, you will stay in the article view if you tap on archive / delete for further reading and have to go back to the list manually.<br />\n\tThen you can activate / deactivate Spritz and configure if you want to download the Spritz data for offline reading, too. Spritz needs to process every article you want to Spritzify on its servers. It either happens during article download (this box checked) or when you try to start the Spritz process (box unchecked or download went wrong).<br />\n\tAnd last but not least a button to logout from the Pocket account which will delete all local articles and force you to login into (possibly another) account.</p>\n<p>Patches: See forum thread for browser patches.</p>\n<p>Changelog:</p>\n<p>1.1.5: Fixed: Sometimes images were not saved correctly. Added: Allow parallel downloads if one article takes a lot of time to download.</p>\n<p>1.1.4: Fixed: Sometimes articles were not properly downloaded after adding.</p>\n<p>1.1.3: Fixed: Spritz data was not downloaded, if spritz disabled on first download but activated later. Fixed some crashes on articles with invalid images.</p>\n<p>1.1.2: Rewrote parts of the content download. Will be more robust now. Fixed some issues with images not showing, too. Also service now is always running, if app is running, so there should be much shorter delays when requesting article content from service.</p>\n<p>1.0.1: Added setting to hide images in article list to speed up scrolling on legacy phones.</p>\n<p>1.0.0: Initial release</p>\n", "Category":"News", "Screenshots":["http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/screenshots/MoboReader-List-downloaded_0.png"], "Source":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/info.mobo_.moboreader_1.1.5_all.ipk", "Type":"Application", "Location":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/info.mobo_.moboreader_1.1.5_all.ipk", "Feed":"PreCentral" }

SyncML support on the server side seems to fade out... the new big thing seems to be caldav.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tSo, I put all my spare time right now into a caldav/carddav synergy connector which is meant to come along with open webos ports, but is also working on legacy devices. The implementation is much more stable, also because caldav protocol is much easier than SyncML. It already gives a pretty stable downsync of calendar and contact data from multiple caldav servers. Upsync is currently worked on. ;) Everything is still in development. Some issues still need to be fixed.</p>\n<p>If you are interested, you can follow development here:<br />\n\thttps://github.com/webOS-ports/org.webosports.service.contacts.carddav<br />\n\t(or my own, more experimental, fork: https://github.com/Garfonso/org.webosports.service.contacts.carddav )<br />\n\t<br />\n\tHopefully we'll see some kind of alpha release, soon.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tIf you are really in need of a SyncML connector and the old one does not meet your needs, feel free to contact me with specific issues and/or wishes.</p>\n<p><br />\n\tOld information:</p>\n<p>This is a synergy integration of SyncML. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncML\">SyncML</a> is a synchronization standard proposed by the <a href=\"http://www.openmobilealliance.org/default.aspx\">open mobile alliance</a>. The main advantage of SyncML is, that it is supported by a wide range of server software. For example webbased groupware solutions usually support SyncML. If you don't want your data in the cloud (google, yahoo, ...) and can not afford an Exchange Server, this is for you. There are serveral solutions that support SyncML (eGroupware, horde, ...) and also dedicated SyncML Servers (for example funambol). Some Network Operators are operating SyncML Servers to allow synchronization of \"dumb\" phones, too, that sometimes are free to use for their customers. A method to implement a local sync for linux boxes is syncevolution, which will work with this app, too.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Servers that are known to be working</strong> (if you have a different setup and it works, feel free to report back):</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tHorde / eGroupware</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tsyncevolution</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tFunambol-Server and myFunambol (onemediahub.com)</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSyncfriend.com</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tlibsynthesis based Servers</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tOracle OCS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSynchronization of Calendar entries (automatic on changes in calendar, periodic, manually triggered in syncml app or in calendar app)</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tDelete accounts from account app</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tEnable/Disable calendar/contacts from account app (contact sync not implemented, yet)</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tCreate account from account app</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tEdit account settings in syncml app (no possibility in account app)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Automatic sync is implemented now. Two options: A periodic sync with different choices of periods and a database watch that will trigger a sync as soon as something on the device is changed. The account can be configured through the SyncML app (see <a href=\"https://github.com/Garfonso/SyncML/wiki/How-To-Use-The-App\">https://github.com/Garfonso/SyncML/wiki/How-To-Use-The-App</a> for more information). You can also now use the account app, this will show the same config scene (this currently does not work on TouchPad).</p>\n<p><strong>Please be sure to have a backup of your data!</strong> I am not responsible for any data loss or data corruption. It is well possible that a misunderstanding between app and your server could cripple your calendar entries (timezone issues are most likely). I suggest everyone to try this with test-data first. For example use a test user or only enter a few data-bits into the client calendar associated with this app.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A first <strong>experimental</strong> version of contact sync now is present. If you feel lucky, test it. Be sure to have a backup, might screw up server data! eGroupware behaves very bad here. Funambol seems to be better. Not really tested with syncevolution, yet.<br />\n\tPictures are working only one way from server. Some servers don't save all the numbers (even if they did send the contact with all the numbers in the first place!). There are encoding issues. Notes required a manual hack, please test.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There will be an account appearing in your accounts app. That is necessary. Don't delete it (if you want to continue using the app). If you delete the app (or want to reinstall) you have to delete the account manually from the account app, <strong>before</strong> unintall, this will clean up all data from the device.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The sync will show you only some (hopefully helpful) logs now, the ugly logs are saved in the file /media/internal/.info.mobo.syncml.log. If the button stops spinning, the sync is finished. If it does not throw error messages on you in the log, everything is fine. <strong>If something is not working, please send the log to me.</strong> There is a \"send log\" entry in the app menu. Please use that!!! I need the log of a synchronization to help you! Please send logs to syncml AT mobo.info. Thanks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This has been testet on Veer, Pre2, Pre3 all running webOs 2.x. The use of 2.2.4 is suggested, 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 of the Veer should work ok. TouchPad (3.0.5) does now work, app looks ugly. Maybe I'll change that sometime. No instant Luna crash on TP anymore.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Changelog:</p>\n<p>2013-06-19 =&gt; 0.1.32<br />\n\t- fixed statistics that are saved in db.<br />\n\t- fixed possible issue that immediate refresh (on slow sync hack) would not happen. Now immediate refresh flag is saved in db.<br />\n\t- fixed possible issue that service won't finish<br />\n\t- fixed retry mechanism. It could keep on trying, even if the message was received or it should stop after 5 retries...<br />\n\t- fixed timeout while calling idle assistant<br />\n\t- fixed wrong message about failed syncs when no changes did happen at all.</p>\n<p>2013-06-18 =&gt; 0.1.31<br />\n\t- service could get killed before sync did finish. Hope to have a fix for that now.<br />\n\t- service periodically prints out its memory usage to the log, now.<br />\n\t- slow sync hack now outputs item statistics for first sync, too.</p>\n<p>2013-06-15 =&gt; 0.1.30<br />\n\t- changed disable slow sync hack, so that sync is now visible in app again.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t2013-06-14 =&gt; 0.1.29<br />\n\t- fixed rev for delete all. Will not send all delete commands to server, if no update did happen.<br />\n\t- hack to disable slow sync. Now only sends recent changes to server and then does a refresh from server.<br />\n\t- readded add, needed for contacts on eGroupware</p>\n<p>2013-06-14 =&gt; 0.1.28<br />\n\t- syncml account now stores server manufactor for hacks<br />\n\t- server next is now again saved in db directly when it is recieved. Should prevent some slow syncs.<br />\n\t- fixed x-vcard and vcard version confusion<br />\n\t- added hacks for eGroupware</p>\n<p>2013-06-11 =&gt; 0.1.27<br />\n\t- switched to vCard (3.0)<br />\n\t- fixed issues with contact sync and notes (from server)<br />\n\t- implemented foto sync for contacts (one way from server)<br />\n\t- switched back to internet confidence \"fair\".<br />\n\t- fixed an issue with contact sync, won't work if synced for the very first time.<br />\n\t- disabled \"add\" again. Now also for new items \"replace\" is used. Never encountered a server that will not just fallback to \"add\". But explicit \"add\" did produce many double entries, sometimes.</p>\n<p>2012-12-06 =&gt; 0.1.26<br />\n\t- quick-fix for an issue with contact sync, won't work if directory for temporary vCards is not present. Sorry, broke that.</p>\n<p>2012-12-05 =&gt; 0.1.25<br />\n\t- fixed an issue with account creation that would hang the service on first sync, if account was created from the app. Sorry for that.<br />\n\t- fixed some more crashes during account creation and initial sync... not sure why they happend, though. :( No initial sync is performed now, you need to do that manually.<br />\n\t- fixed issue with allday events and alarms that would shift one hour (again? :()<br />\n\t- fixed issue with contact encoding stuff, should be fine now.</p>\n<p>2012-10-07 =&gt; 0.1.23<br />\n\t- fixed issue with sync of multiple data sources.<br />\n\t- fixed check credentials issue for funambol servers (like privat ones or onemediahub.com)<br />\n\t- results of last 10 syncs are now saved in db (i.e. if sync was ok, method of sync, how many objects were changed)<br />\n\t- implemented first <strong>experimental</strong> version of contact sync</p>\n<p>2012-08-22 =&gt; 0.1.22<br />\n\t- fixed timeout mechanism<br />\n\t- fixed issue with two-way-sync if there was no data transmitted at all.</p>\n<p>2012-08-15 =&gt; 0.1.21<br />\n\t- changed watch activity so that it delays for 1 minute, so the user has enough time to complete his changes. Every new change during that 1 minute will delay the sync further.<br />\n\t- changed requirement of activities to \"internetConfidence: fair\" so the syncs should have a higher probability to complete, now.<br />\n\t- changed behaviour, service now tries to \"add\" events on the server, until now only \"replace\" was called, no matter if they were new or not.</p>\n<p>2012-08-01 =&gt; 0.1.20<br />\n\t- fixed app to work after profil restore, username + password cannot be decrypted and need to be configured again. Also a refresh-from-server sync is triggered.<br />\n\t- added additional timeout guard for network connections, so they (hopefully) don't hang forever on bad reception.<br />\n\t- now lastRev is reset on a slow-sync or refresh. This will also help after profile restore.</p>\n<p>2012-07-10 =&gt; 0.1.19<br />\n\t- fixed activities, they don't need to be deleted anymore.<br />\n\t- fixed issue where for one account there could be multiple calendars.<br />\n\t- fixed issue that prevented service from shutting down after sync if the app was still open.</p>\n<p>2012-07-05 =&gt; 0.1.18<br />\n\t- \"Sync Now\" in calendar app works<br />\n\t- a back from sync did overwrite data in the accounts after a successful sync. This could trigger unecessary slow syncs and duplication on the server.<br />\n\t- fixed that app pops up during configuration of a new account in account manager<br />\n\t- now shows what sources are synced with what method in the app/log.<br />\n\t- fixed push device info (check for refreshs did not work), also changed that we now also request the device info on refreshs/slow sync.</p>\n<p>2012-07-04 =&gt; 0.1.17<br />\n\t- Implemented automatic sync. There is a periodic sync and a db watch. Both can be enabled/disabled in the config scene for each account. db watch is pretty experimental.<br />\n\t- Changed device info behaviour: Own device info is only send if no device info from server is present or if we are doing a refresh or slow sync.</p>\n<p>2012-06-11 =&gt; 0.1.16<br />\n\t- fixed possible service crash during delete on server.</p>\n<p>2012-06-02 =&gt; 0.1.15<br />\n\t- enabled b64 encoding of iCal data. Helps with not confusing XML parsers.<br />\n\t- added X-AlldayEvent cue for syncfriend.com.<br />\n\t- no VALARM for x-vcalendar.<br />\n\t- tried to fix allday for x-vcalendar.</p>\n<p>2012-06-01 =&gt; 0.1.14<br />\n\t- again doing UTC behaviour. TZID=... seems to be ignored if VTIMEZONE is not there. This should be perfectly fine for all normal events with start/endtime. Issues might arise with allday events, though. Need to test more servers with our shift allDay behaviour (eGroupware works ;)).<br />\n\t- implemented support for X-FUNAMBOL-ALLDAY and X-MICROSOFT-CDO-ALLDAYEVENT allday cues.<br />\n\t- fixed bug that prevented slow sync from working at all :(<br />\n\t- fixed retry send message mechanism</p>\n<p>2012-05-31 =&gt; 0.1.13<br />\n\t- reverted the UTC behaviour. Now sending TZID=... parameter. Issue: ical rfc requests VTIMEZONE for that also. I'm not sure if we can create that one... issue with UTC is allday events. Always the same trouble. :(</p>\n<p>2012-05-31 =&gt; 0.1.12<br />\n\t- fixed tz issue, now transfering everything as UTC.<br />\n\t- changed behaviour of old log files to not truncate but move them.</p>\n<p>2012-05-28 =&gt; 0.1.11<br />\n\t- fixed reset service<br />\n\t- added some hacks to support Syncfriend.com<br />\n\t- added some fixes to support alarm parsing from OCS server.</p>\n<p>2012-05-27 =&gt; 0.1.10<br />\n\t- fixed possible failure if put device info is not supported.<br />\n\t- set delete event not to purge db to prevent alarms from sticking.<br />\n\t- cleaned up MimeTypes in device info (thanks to Matthias)</p>\n<p>2012-05-26 =&gt; 0.1.9<br />\n\t- fixed issues with account creation and deletion on webOS 2.1.1.<br />\n\t- hotifx: fixed issue with account management if no account was present, yet.<br />\n\t- hotfix: fixed issue with keymanager if no key was present, yet.</p>\n<p>2012-05-26 =&gt; 0.1.8<br />\n\t- hopefully solved deadlock during account creation.<br />\n\t- locks for the service calls are now much less restrictive<br />\n\t- app can even reattach to a running sync. :)<br />\n\t- solved issue where all controls in configScene would be disabled if service was still running after create account from account app.<br />\n\t- solved another issue with syncEvolution<br />\n\t- improved account deletion, possible associated webOS accounts will be deleted again.</p>\n<p>2012-05-23 =&gt; 0.1.7<br />\n\t- changed behaviour to not send last anchor, if not present.<br />\n\t- fixed account creation / modification / deletion from app.</p>\n<p>2012-05-22 =&gt; 0.1.4<br />\n\t- implemented \"local\" fix of AjaxCall to work with non standard http ports.<br />\n\t- added \"Delete this account\" - Button to config scene to delete accounts. Deletes accounts only from the apps db. If there exists a webOS account, delete it from the accounts app (should also delete app's account object).<br />\n\t- tried to add some more error messages to log files.<br />\n\t- fixed issue with attached E-Mail log (thanks to Matthias)</p>\n<p>2012-05-21 =&gt; 0.1.3<br />\n\t- fixed possible issue during parsing of device data from server<br />\n\t- fixed locking up of modifyAccount calls during storeAccount. Race condition with onCredentialsChanged call. We don't really use onCredentialsChanged, anyway.<br />\n\t- fixed issues were the app lost connection to the service and would hang forever in the sync scene. (Now this only happens if the service itself crashes)<br />\n\t- fixed account icons</p>\n<p>2012-05-20 =&gt; 0.1.2<br />\n\t- Ignoring 406 errors = optional feature not supported. Maybe that helps with oracle server.<br />\n\t- Added menu entry to reset the service. Only use this if you are sure that the service hangs and you don't want to wait for the timeout (one minute without service calls).</p>\n<p>2012-05-20 =&gt; 0.1.1<br />\n\t- added repairDBPermission.sh script into app folder to repair db permissions. Issues might arise, if the app was installed before submitted to webos nation. Careful: Script might delete all data. See forum for more information on that issue!</p>\n<p>2012-05-20 =&gt; 0.1.0<br />\n\t- Major change: Implemented node.js service.<br />\n\t- App only calls service functions<br />\n\t- Cleaned up log in the app itself considerably!<br />\n\t- Writing exhaustive log to /media/internal/.info.mobo.syncml.log (accessible in usb-mode)<br />\n\t- Not logging passwords (hopefully)<br />\n\t- Passwords and usernames stored only encrypted<br />\n\t- Integration into account app, delete and disable / enable of calendar/contacts works<br />\n\t- Create from account manager works partially (need to find out how to prevent it from spawning the welcome scene and popping it to front)<br />\n\t- E-Mail log improved, adds log-file as attachment<br />\n\t- log is truncated at 2MB, that means many sync processes can be kept in log and logs can be send way after the sync process that failed.<br />\n\t- Touchpad now works.</p>\n<p>2012-05-17 =&gt; 0.0.16<br />\n\t- added a status description above log output. Should help with outside errors, like wrong credentials or connection aborts.<br />\n\t- changed behavior, app won't suggest slow sync (happened too often). On broken sync the server should request a slow sync anyway.</p>\n<p>2012-05-14<br />\n\t- fixed some issues with account creation. Should now work again.<br />\n\t- now 0.0.15 is sending capability description to the server. This might help in some cases where synchronization is not working. Hopefully this does not break anything.</p>\n<p>2012-05-01<br />\n\t- fixed a bug that prevented events with recurrence on a first Sunday of a month to be handled correctly.<br />\n\t- fixed a bug that prevented aalarms to be interpreted correctly.</p>\n<p>2012-04-25<br />\n\t- fixed bug that prevent any action if no account was specified.</p>\n", "Category":"Entreprise", "Screenshots":["http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/screenshots/Handy_welcome.png"], "Source":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/info.mobo_.syncml_0.1.32_all.ipk", "Type":"Application", "Location":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/info.mobo_.syncml_0.1.32_all.ipk", "Feed":"PreCentral" }

This particular version pits you against my programming skills, anthropomorphized as the computer. The two opponents in cribbage are referred to as the 'dealer' and the 'pone', switching positions with each deal. The object is to accumulate points faster than your opponent up to a target of either 61 or 121 points. Points are awarded for a variety of hands (including combinations of card values totaling 15, runs, flushes, and multiple cards of a given number) both during play and during the showing of the hands. A board is traditionally used to keep track of the score, with pegs being moved along a track of holes. The game has been around since sometime in the 17th century, and is a perennial favorite of pub-goers and PDA/smart-phone users everywhere. </p>\nNew beta version (0.3.24) available through the homebrew site. This makes more changes to the player stats, and should be backwards compatible (although newer features will not be able to make use of old stats...). I have also added a few tweaks to make it more compatible with webOS 2.

International phone calls and texting SMS messages are the focus for that. For example, still paying high rates for mobile calls <strong>towards</strong> international contacts abroad? Or paying 50 cents or more for texting an international SMS <strong>from</strong>  abroad? Tired of changing phone numbers such as 020 555 7878 into international format such as +3120 555 7878, when calling <strong>from</strong> abroad? It looks like iDialPlan SMSi is tailor made for you.\n\n<ul><li>Support for inexpensive international mobile calls through your Service Provider using their land line local access numbers(call trough or calling card based).</li>\n\n<li>An SMSi client, SMS over Internet, for texting to any phone at rates as low as 3-5 cent (Nov'10) also for SMS <strong>from</strong> abroad using <strong>your</strong> SMSi service provider.</li> \n\n<li>On the fly number adjustment, setup by an easy to use, yet flexible 'your homeland &amp; country to visit' based wizard. </li> \n\n<li>Service Providers of choice can be setup by the user both for call through and for SMSi. Two sample providers are preloaded, but no endorsements of any type here! Call back is not supported and SMSi services must be based on 'HTTP-get'</li>\n\n<li>Mostly unique features include: integration option with the Pre standard dialer and your contacts list, group texting, SMS to email archiving, preset message templates, long message tailoring, char set translation, support for your provider. </li>\n\n</ul>\n</p> <p>When using iDialPan, contact numbers need no manual adjustment, your listed contact numbers are automatically adjusted on the fly during call time. And on the fly adjustments depend on where you are: home, abroad and/ or using a call through or SMSi service provider.\n</p> <p>iDP exists of an App (this one) that can be used stand alone or for trying and must be used for SMSi. There is also an optional patch to integrate iDP on the fly adjustment in the standard Pre phone dialer. It is available at <a href=\"http://forums.precentral.net/homebrew-apps/226937-idialplan-automatic-number-adjustment-international-calling-travelers.html#post2178249\">the official iDialPlan forum.</a>\n</p> <p>Though developed for the GSM model Pre, iDP can be used on the CDMA model too. The SMSi client should work and for phone calls one could for example add 'hide my number' or similar prefixes like #xx* on the fly during call time.The CDMA Pre already has an international dialing option under phone preference, the GSM model does not. And, should that CDMA capability be patched for usage on the GSM model, that international capability cannot cope with the many situations GSM countries require.\n\n</p><p><strong>Number Adjustment Features</strong></p> <ul>   <li>On the fly adjustment of a Contact phone number so it is dialed OK from abroad, i.e change 020 555 6767 into +31 20 555 6767. The listing in Contacts is not changed.</li>   \n<li>SMSi (SMS over Internet to any phone) number adjustment. Most providers require international format, but vary in using 00/011 or +.</li>\n<li>Automatic on-the fly support for call through Service Providers such as Voipbuster or calling cards access numbers for calls to abroad, i.e. +31 (0)20 555 2323 will be changed into 030 3119 0303 pp 0031 20 555 2323. The local access number, post &amp; prefixes and pauses are automatically inserted at the right place when dialing an international Contact.</li>   <li>Other (non-international) adjustments of contact phone numbers <i>during call time</i> supported, i.e. a landline listing number without an area code like 555 8989 is automatically changed into 020 555 8989 . (Or to the international equivalent when calling form abroad to home.</li> <li>Comment stripping from contacts listings: all character behind a slash are considered comment: for example when having comment about extensions in Contact such as \"020 555 7878 / 1212 is office manager\"</li><li>The dial plan wizard's adjustments are fully programmable by the user,should that be needed. The programming is done by an optimized dialplan language PhRE (c) supported in the App.</li>   <li>Support for countries that do not have area codes and/or do not require national access (\"0\") or require the national access \"zero\" to be part of international numbers (Italy).</li>   <li>Optional (recommended) integration of the dialplan in the Pre standard dialer by a separate patch.</li> \n</ul>\n\nThe latest iDP patch (0.9.0) is webOS 1.4.5 and 1.4.1 compatible. Earlier versions of the IDP patch and App cannot be mixed. (0.9.y needs 0.9.x, x and y don't matter). Patch version 0.9 is also compatible with App version 1.0.x. See the official iDP thread if patch v 0.9 is not yet available through Preware or webOS Quick Install.\n\nJust drop the patch  and the App on Quick Install or use Preware.

We certify and rank beer judges through an examination and monitoring process. <br /><br />  <b>What are the Style Guidelines?</b><br /><br /> Styles are a convenient shorthand for discussing beer. They allow all those who are tasting and describing a beer to use a common framework and language. Style Guidelines are designed to assist organizers, entrants and judges participating in beer, mead and cider competitions by providing a standardized set of descriptions of beer, mead and cider styles.<br /><br />  The styles included in the guidelines are not meant to describe every beer style made in the world (at least not yet). They are meant to cover the most common ones entered in homebrew competitions. The style descriptions are based on currently acknowledged world class examples, historical references to styles no longer brewed, and writings of noted beer researchers and journalists. <br /><br /> In a competition setting, the Style Guidelines provide guidance to judges so that there is a level playing field for all entrants. Judges and entrants are both using the same descriptions, so the decision on \"which beer is best?\" is based less on personal whim of the judges and more on how well the entered beer matches world class commercial examples of the style. <br /><br /> Style guidelines assist competition organizers by grouping together beer styles of similar characteristic for judging purposes. Judges have an easier time selecting the best beer in a flight if there is as little variation as possible. Grouping beer styles together into categories makes this easier. Category groupings are somewhat arbitrary at times, since some beer styles don't necessarily have strong historical, regional or cultural ties to other styles.   <br/><br/>  <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=TA5W4KJM9Z3PL&lc=US&item_name=BJCP%20Palm%20Pre%20Style%20Guidelines%20Development&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"/sites/webosnation.com/files/resource_images/b/btn_donate_LG.gif\" alt=\"Donate\" /></a><br /><br /> <br /><br />For more information visit: <a href=\"http://www.bjcp.org\">http://www.bjcp.org</a></p>", "Category":"Reference", "Screenshots":["http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/screenshots/styleguide_2009-08-10_23065.png"], "Source":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/org.bjcp_.styleguide_1.0.4_all.ipk", "Type":"Application", "Location":"http://weboslives.eu/sites/webosnation.com/files/apps/org.bjcp_.styleguide_1.0.4_all.ipk", "Feed":"PreCentral" }
